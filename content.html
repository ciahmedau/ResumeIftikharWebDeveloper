    <p>By using the world's most popular CMS, WordPress, we can design you a beautiful, mobile responsive website. A website that will gets your phone ringing. By utilising a responsive design technique, your website will automatically adjust to fit mobile
        and tablet screens of all sizes. Be it an iPhone, Android or iPad, our work can create a mobile web design, known as responsive web design with features including <br> Responsive mobile screen resolutions<br> Easy touch friendly menu (just like
        Facebook)<br> Streamlined design built for touch navigation<br> We can update your website once and both your normal and mobile website is updated Touchable call-to-actions with prominent phone numbers and quick contact forms<br>
        <p> When designing and creating your website we can use the WordPress platform. <br> WordPress is a Content Management System (CMS) and one of the most widely used platforms for websites. We find that WordPress has the best technologies and is easy
            to use for all levels of computer users. Another reason for using WordPress is the hundreds of themes that are available for us to use and customise to give you the exact website you want and need for your business. <br> Another feature is
            the large range of Plugins available for WordPress which allows you to do anything you want with your website from an online timetable, galleries, slideshows, online chat, online store etc.
        </p>
        <h4>Search engine optimization</h4>
        <p> After the design and creation of website is complete, we start the Search Engine Optimisation. This includes the basic listing on Google My Business, Bing and smaller search engines but also behind the scenes to ensure each page is optimised.
            It’s one thing to have a great looking site but if it’s not optimised then it’s a waste of your time and money. <br>
        </p>
        <h4>Web Developer using HTML,CSS, JavaScript </h4>
        <p>
            This is good for simple websites. Following are advantages of HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery Option HTML is easy to use and understand<br> Almost anyone in the web development business would know HTML – be it a freelancer or a large agency. If
            at any point in time you need to hire the services of a different web design firm or professional for making changes or updates to your website, it would be relatively easy to find cost-effective and affordable solution providers who can make
            the changes you need to your website.<br> All browsers support HTML<br> All browsers support HTML. Certainly, more browsers support HTML than any other web programming language. As a result, when you build a website using HTML, it would show
            up on most browsers around the world, if the programmer takes care to optimize the website for the most commonly used browsers. Optimizing an HTML based website for browser compatibility is neither difficult nor complex.<br> HTML and XML syntax
            is very similar<br> Today, XML is increasingly being used for data storage. The similarity of syntax between HTML and XML means that it is easier and seamless working between the two platforms.<br> HTML is free<br> A major advantage of HTML
            is that it is free. You do not need any software for HTML, no plug-ins are needed and it means that you can save considerably on your website development cost. Even with open source content management systems, all the plug-ins that you may
            need are not always free.<br> Most development tools support HTML<br> Whether it is FrontPage, Dreamweaver or any other programming tool, there are more web development tools that allow you to create HTML based websites, than any other web
            programming language.<br> HTML is most search engine friendly<br> Of all the web programming languages, HTML is the most search engine friendly. Creating SEO compliant websites using HTML is significantly easier than any other programming
            language. HTML causes the least SEO complications and provides the greatest flexibility when trying to build an SEO compliant website. If you have taken care to ensure your HTML code is clean and validated, an HTML website is easiest to read
            and access for search engine crawlers. This reduces crawling time and improves page load time, helping your website perform better in search results.
